This is a pseudocode representation of the functioning of the program.








    -- mygrep.cpp --


if ./mygrep ?:
    give some instructions

if no arguments given:
    ask for search term and content string

    try:
        check that strings are appropriate lengths
    catch:
        runtime error

    search for the term from the content

    quit program (0)

if inappropriate amount of arguments:
    give instructions

    quit program (1)

if 3 arguments (./mygrep <arg1> <arg2>) and <arg1> doesn't begin with -0
    assign arg1 to search term
    assign arg2 to content

    try:
        searchFromFile
    catch:
        some errors

    quit program (0)

if 4 arguments (./mygrep <arg1> <arg2> <arg3>)
    assign arg1 to options
    assign arg2 to search term
    assign arg3 to content

    for length of options:

        if first two characters are "-o":
            switch options
            case option
                option = true
                break
        
        else
            throw exception:
                incorrect usage of arguments
    
    end loop

    try:
        searchFromFile
    catch:
        some errors

quit program (0)








    -- searchForString --



Parameters: (content, searchTerm)

char* pointer to content
char* pointer to search term

size_t size of content
size_t size of search term

if ignore case enabled:
    convert both strings to lowercase

for all characters in content:

    if current character == first character of search term:

        check the next characters together:
            add 1 to matchingCharacters
            continue to next letter
        
        if next letter doesnt match:
            reset matchingCharacters
            continue to next letter
        
    if matchingCharacters == size of search term:
        return the index of the first letter matched in content

end loop
because no matches found, return 1'000'000'000








    -- searchFromFile --



Parameters: (content, searchTerm)

open file by name (content)

if file didn't open:
    throw runtime error

for all lines in file:
    if reading fails:
        throw runtime error
    
    if search term found:
        if reverse search is ON:
            do nothing
        if reverse search is OFF:
            output line to console with selected options
    
    if search term NOT found:
        do the opposite

end loop

display occurences if user asked
close file
